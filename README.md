# Protocolize
A lightweight BungeeCord protocol framework supporting items.
## Purpose
Protocolize had been developed to raise the amount of game changing possibilities on BungeeCord platforms. With Protocolize it is possible to create custom inventories or interact with the player inventory itself. Protocolize is also ready for future upscaling! It is easy to self-implement custom packets using the *de.exceptionflug.protocolize.AbstractPacket* class.
## Compatibility
Protocolize is still in early development. We cannot ensure that everything will work when using custom packet implementations.
## How To Use
Please take a look at the examples which I made: https://github.com/Exceptionflug/protocolize/tree/master/protocolize-examples/src/main/java/de/exceptionflug/protocolize/example
